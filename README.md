# hello-world

I would like to learn further in HTML and CSS and be able to remember at minimum the basic starting points for an index.html file
at least the basic .css things to change fonts, colours etc without having to look them up.  With focus just on Web Design I know
I can become a better designer and apply for jobs within this field
